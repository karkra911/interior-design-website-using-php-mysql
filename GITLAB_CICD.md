# GitLab CI/CD Configuration for CodeVault

This document explains the CI/CD pipeline configuration for the CodeVault project on GitLab.

## Pipeline Overview

Our GitLab CI/CD pipeline includes 6 stages:

### 1. 🔍 **Validate Stage**
- **PHP Syntax Check**: Validates all PHP files for syntax errors
- **Code Quality**: Runs code quality checks and standards validation

### 2. 🧪 **Test Stage**
- **Unit Tests**: Runs application unit tests with MySQL database
- **Database Tests**: Validates database schema and connectivity
- **Integration Tests**: Tests application components together

### 3. 🔒 **Security Stage**
- **Security Scan**: Checks for common security vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scan**: Scans for vulnerable dependencies
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis for security issues

### 4. 🏗️ **Build Stage**
- **Build Application**: Creates deployment packages
- **Generate Artifacts**: Produces build artifacts for deployment

### 5. 🚀 **Deploy Stage**
- **Staging Deployment**: Deploys to staging environment (manual)
- **Production Deployment**: Deploys to production (manual, main branch only)

### 6. 📊 **Monitor Stage**
- **Health Checks**: Validates application health post-deployment
- **Performance Tests**: Monitors application performance
- **Database Backup**: Scheduled database backups

## Environment Variables

Configure these in GitLab Project Settings > CI/CD > Variables:

### Required Variables:
```
STAGING_HOST=your-staging-server.com
STAGING_USER=staging_user
STAGING_PATH=/path/to/staging
PRODUCTION_HOST=your-production-server.com
PRODUCTION_USER=production_user
PRODUCTION_PATH=/path/to/production
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_USER=your-db-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password (mark as protected)
```

### Optional Variables:
```
SLACK_WEBHOOK=https://hooks.slack.com/your-webhook
EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS=admin@yoursite.com
```

## Pipeline Triggers

### Automatic Triggers:
- **Push to main branch**: Full pipeline with production deployment option
- **Push to develop branch**: Full pipeline with staging deployment option
- **Merge Requests**: Validation and testing stages only
- **Tags**: Full pipeline with release deployment

### Manual Triggers:
- **Staging Deployment**: Manual trigger for develop branch
- **Production Deployment**: Manual trigger for main branch
- **Health Checks**: On-demand health validation
- **Performance Tests**: On-demand performance testing

## Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment:
1. Push to `develop` branch
2. Pipeline runs validation and tests
3. Manually trigger staging deployment
4. Application deployed to staging environment

### Production Deployment:
1. Merge to `main` branch or create a tag
2. Pipeline runs full test suite
3. Build artifacts are created
4. Manually trigger production deployment
5. Health checks run automatically

## Security Features

### Automated Security Checks:
- ✅ PHP syntax validation
- ✅ SQL injection detection
- ✅ Hardcoded password detection
- ✅ File permission validation
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Security Best Practices:
- All sensitive variables are marked as protected
- Deployment credentials are encrypted
- Manual approval required for production deployments
- Audit trail for all deployments

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Health Monitoring:
- Application endpoint checks
- Database connectivity validation
- Performance metrics collection
- Error rate monitoring

### Notifications:
- Pipeline success/failure notifications
- Deployment status updates
- Security scan results
- Performance degradation alerts

## Artifact Management

### Build Artifacts:
- Application deployment packages
- Test results and coverage reports
- Security scan reports
- Performance test results

### Retention Policy:
- Build artifacts: 1 week
- Test results: 1 month
- Security reports: 3 months
- Logs: 1 week

## Database Management

### Automated Tasks:
- Schema validation in tests
- Database migrations (if applicable)
- Backup creation and validation
- Performance monitoring

### Manual Tasks:
- Production database backups
- Schema updates
- Data migrations

## Performance Optimization

### Pipeline Optimization:
- Caching for dependencies
- Parallel job execution
- Conditional pipeline execution
- Artifact reuse between stages

### Application Optimization:
- Database query performance monitoring
- Page load time tracking
- Memory usage analysis
- Cache hit rate monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Pipeline Fails at Validation Stage:**
- Check PHP syntax in all files
- Verify file permissions
- Review code quality standards

**Database Tests Fail:**
- Verify database.sql syntax
- Check MySQL version compatibility
- Validate table relationships

**Deployment Fails:**
- Check server connectivity
- Verify credentials and permissions
- Review deployment paths

**Security Scan Issues:**
- Review flagged security issues
- Update vulnerable dependencies
- Fix hardcoded credentials

### Getting Help:
1. Check pipeline logs for detailed error messages
2. Review GitLab CI/CD documentation
3. Contact the development team
4. Create an issue in the project repository

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
- Automated testing with Selenium
- Code coverage reporting
- Performance regression testing
- Blue-green deployments
- Rollback capabilities
- Multi-environment support

### Integration Opportunities:
- Slack/Teams notifications
- Jira issue tracking
- SonarQube code quality
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes deployment
