## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of CodeVault seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: [your-email@example.com]

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Our Commitment

- We will respond to your report within 48 hours
- We will keep you informed of the progress toward fixing the vulnerability
- We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will not pursue legal action against researchers who report vulnerabilities in good faith

## Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- Secure password hashing using PHP's `password_hash()` function
- Session-based authentication
- User session management and timeout
- Proper logout functionality

### Database Security
- SQL injection prevention using prepared statements
- Database connection encryption
- Proper database user permissions
- Input validation and sanitization

### Input Validation
- Server-side validation for all user inputs
- HTML entity encoding to prevent XSS
- CSRF protection measures
- File upload restrictions (if applicable)

### Session Security
- Secure session configuration
- Session regeneration on login
- Proper session cleanup on logout
- Session timeout implementation

### General Security Practices
- Error handling without information disclosure
- Secure HTTP headers implementation
- Regular dependency updates
- Code review processes

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Administrators
1. Change default credentials immediately after installation
2. Use strong, unique passwords
3. Keep the application updated
4. Regularly backup your database
5. Monitor access logs
6. Use HTTPS in production
7. Implement proper server security measures

### For Developers
1. Keep dependencies updated
2. Follow secure coding practices
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Use prepared statements for database queries
5. Validate and sanitize all inputs
6. Implement proper authentication checks
7. Regular security audits

## Known Security Considerations

### Areas of Focus
- User input validation
- Database query security
- Session management
- File handling (if applicable)
- Authentication bypass attempts

### Recommended Production Setup
- Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS)
- Implement rate limiting
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Regular security monitoring
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Update server software regularly

## Security Headers

Recommended security headers for production deployment:

```apache
# .htaccess example
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload"
Header always set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'"
```

## Regular Security Tasks

### Monthly
- Review access logs
- Check for failed login attempts
- Update dependencies
- Review user accounts

### Quarterly
- Security audit
- Penetration testing
- Code review
- Backup testing

### Annually
- Comprehensive security assessment
- Update security policies
- Review and update documentation
- Security training for team members
